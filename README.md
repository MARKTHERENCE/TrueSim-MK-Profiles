# TrueSim-MK-Profiles
Various amp schematics translated into .TXT files, made for the guitar amp sim plugin "[TrueSim]( https://nalexsoftware.blogspot.com/2022/07/truesim-simulator.html )" developed by [NaLex Software]( https://nalexsoftware.blogspot.com ).
Circuits are made with TrueSimCircuit, potentiometer knobs are rearranged via text editing.

## IMPORTANT!
Only the preamp circuits are ported. You will need a 3rd party power amp sim after. Below are the ones I would recommend:
- [Ignite Amps TPA-1]( https://www.igniteamps.com/#tpa-1 )
- [NaLex PowerBox]( https://nalexsoftware.blogspot.com/2020/05/powerbox-poweramp.html )
- [Nick Crow Lab TubeDriver]( https://nickcrowlab.blogspot.com/2009/08/tubedriver-v10.html )

Refer to the [README.md from the Amplex-MK-Presets]( https://github.com/MARKTHERENCE/Amplex-MK-Presets/tree/main#setting-up-the-power-amp ) for instructions on how to set them up.

# List of Amp Models
This collection covers a wide range of amplifier types based on gain amount, voicing, etc. This is never set in stone as I may add more amp models at any given time.

## Single Channel
- Marshall Vintage Modern 2266/2466
- Trainwreck Liverpool*

## High Gain
- Ceriatone Plexi 100 Super Lead Dookie Mod
- Orange #4 TT15 Jim Root Terror

## Multi Channel
- Ibanez Thermion TN120
- Kitty Hawk Quattro Preamp

*Some amp models might need adjustment from the Input knob for accurate gain levels. Refer to the extra notes in the .txts themselves.
